            Uses U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) site, the USGS provides
            earthquake data from there API , updated every 5 minutes. I Created
            a map using Leaflet that plots the earthquakes from data set based
            on their longitude and latitude.

              I did this Project was from a Course I took on Udemy,the HTML/CSS was already 
              done , I programmed the JavaScript code and made it work.
              <br>
              The goal was the learning arrays, objects, function and methods
              How they all work as one and how to Structure a site to run
              efficiently.
              <p>

              Account login Butten in red once there a 2nd and you can use:
              Username : <strong>sg : pin 1111 </strong> and Username
              <strong>im : pin 2222</strong>
              </p>

              I did this Project was from a Course I took on Udemy, the goal was to learn the Programming Paradigm:  <b>Object-oriented programming (OOP)</b> the HTML and CSS were already created by the class as the focus is on the JavaScript. I programmed the JavaScript using Leaflet.js.  
              <br><br>
              The app will ask for your Geo location based on your browser and use this information within the app.  
              you can see the code there <a href="https://github.com/sonyamg80/sonyamg80.github.io/tree/main/mapty" target="_blank">Github</a> <br><br>

 

            The app data is saved using local storage you can clear the data by inspecting the page, 
            the console and typing <b>app.reset()</b>

        <div class="tab">

          <label for="tab-4" class="tab-label">Weather Site Analysis</label>
          <div class="tab-content">
            <p>
              <a href="weather/index.html" target="_blank">Site Link</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              I built this website using data and work that was done with the
              project website. I took the plots and images from my python
              project. I created a python script to graph using plotly , then
              saved each graph as its own image. I then embedded them using I
              frame.
